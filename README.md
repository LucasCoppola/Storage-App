# Storage App

Designed and developed a CRUD web application for companies to store and manage their products. The application provides user registration and login, allowing users to create, edit, and delete products and associated images. The application provides a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to manage their product inventory. The application is scalable and maintainable, with room for future feature enhancements based on user feedback.

This application is for companies that need to manage inventory, track product information, or share product information with team members.
